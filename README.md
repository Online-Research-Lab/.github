## 🌟 About Us

With ORLab, we are pioneering a new approach to teach and learn qualitative research. We believe that the methodologies of social theory can be taught and learnt by everyone. That's why we demonstrate expert techniques, encourage mimetic processes, and provide immediate feedback.

### Sharing Great Work
We are convinced that excellent work should be made available to all. That's why we encourage our students and collaborators to share their work via one of our core features, the **Showcase**.

## 🏛 Foundational Pillars

We try to rethink qualitative research and how it is taught, utilising established as well as innovative approaches.

* **Proven Methodologies:** Discover methodologies in use, displayed with original data, tasks, and hints for learning. Showcases provide a comprehensive look at the process, from initial research question to final interpretation.
* **Open Source:** ORLab is a platform for broad participation. Get inspired and work with teachers, students, and others on data and methodologies with one simple aim: Really understanding what’s going on in the education system and sharing your methodological approach with others.
* **Interactive:** Methodologies cannot be learned through technology alone. To get a sense of each methodology, it is necessary to try it out independently, think with peers, and get expert feedback when needed.
